# Wordspace-solver

Command line tool written in Python that prints out all individual English words that can be created from a given set of letters (no repeated letters, no spaces), and arranges these words by frequency.

English dictionary and word frequencies are taken from the SUBTLEX-US corpus: https://www.ugent.be/pp/experimentele-psychologie/en/research/documents/subtlexus

Frequencies are displayed as Zipf values.
